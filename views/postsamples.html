<p>Book your stay at El Conquistador Resort, a Waldorf Astoria Resort that offers five unique villages, each with panoramic views of ocean waters. The resort has a whopping 20 restaurants, serving everything from seafood delicacies to Pan-Asian delights to wraps and salads.</p>
<p>Facilities include a golf course, marina, spa, tennis courts, pools, water park, and a wide variety of bars. The resort also has its own private island- Palomino Island- just off the east coast of Puerto Rico.</p>


<p>Be sure to book an excursion out to Bio Bay to witness one of the most beautiful natural phenomenons on Earth. Bio Bay is home to millions of bioluminescent organisms, which emit bluish light when agitated, and are quite stunning against the backdrop of the black Caribbean sea at night.</p>
<p>Tours leave in the early evening with a qualified instructor, so kayak your way through mangrove channels to the glowing waters!</p>


<p>Hop a short flight (or a longer, but cheaper, ferry ride) to Culebra Island, seventeen miles east of the Puerto Rico mainland. Culebra coaxes visitors from all over due to its beautiful beaches and nature reserves. Once you’ve arrived, rent a gold cart and explore!</p>

<p>The two must-see beaches on Culbera are Flamenco and Tamarindo, and make sure to grab a drink at Mamacita’s!</p>
